# [Blockchair.Whitepapers](https://blockchair.com/whitepapers)

This is our public repository for the whitepaper list our search engine indexes. Please feel free to add new whitepapers (yours or someone's else) either by editing the [Whitepapers.md file](https://github.com/Blockchair/Blockchair.Whitepapers/edit/master/Whitepapers.md) (this is the fastest way, and please don't forget to keep whitepapers in alphabetical order), by contacting us via e-mail [whitepapers@blockchair.com](mailto:whitepapers@blockchair.com), or by opening [a "New Issue"](https://github.com/Blockchair/Blockchair.Whitepapers/issues/new) with a link to the whitepaper).

There is just one rule: the whitepaper you add should be somehow connected to the blockchain technology (i.e. it should describe a cryptocurrency, an ICO, a consensus mechanism, and so on). Your whitepaper will be added as soon as our moderator examines it. Wait a second, there's the second rule: the whitepaper should be in PDF format.

Thanks!
